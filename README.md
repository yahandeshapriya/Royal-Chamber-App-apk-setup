This is the apk setup file of the Royal Chamber Mobile Application 

Our project idea is to create a mobile application for the clothing and 
accessories outlet to enhance their business activities and sales across 
the online platform. ROYAL CHAMBER is the name of our business 
organization. This is situated in Colombo city. 
The main objective of creating a mobile application is to provide an 
opportunity for consumers to buy their favourite clothing and 
accessories and obtain such products through online service. Consumers 
do not need to visit the shop to collect goods. The online service will 
provide home delivery service to the customers.
Using this mobile application, the customers can obtain various 
advantages such as time saving, cost saving for travelling, selecting 
various products through the application, safe delivery facility etc.
At the same time, Royal Chamber company also get the benefits such as 
increase of sales, develop more relationship with consumers, increase 
the profit, save the advertisement cost, display and introduce various 
products to the general public etc.
